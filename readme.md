Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

##  Dan's Notes
[Live Demo](p3.dannovember.me)

Howdy! The landing page prompts you to create fake accounts or Lorem Ipsum paragraphs! Either option provides the selections on the left hand side and after hitting submit/generate the requested information appears on the right retaining the information entered on the left.

[Screencast Demo](youtube or something)

There are no special requirements for the app, except for Dan to know that I thought about how awesome cat's are while I built this site.

External Sources Used:

+ Bootstrap for css
+ Faker to generate fake information for accounts
+ Badcow for the lorem ipsum
+ Google to fix my stoopidness
